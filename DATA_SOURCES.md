Learn Jakarta EE Data Sources
=============================

This document contains the approaches one may take to configure data sources
in a Jakarta EE application. The projects in this repository are using the
fifth approach in this document.

[1] Using @DataSourceDefinition
===========================
This is a convenient way to set up a database in a Java file. Here is a sample file:

```
package io.github.learnjakartaee.config;

import jakarta.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinition;
import jakarta.ejb.Startup;

@DataSourceDefinition(
		name = "java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource",
		className = "org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDataSource",
		databaseName = "memory:appdb",
		user = "APP",
		password = "",
		properties = {
				"createDatabase=create"
		})
@@ApplicationScoped
public class DataSourceConfiguration {

	@Resource(lookup="java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource")
	DataSource dataSource;
	
	@Produces
	public DataSource getDatasource() {
		return dataSource;
	}	
}
```

The configuration defines a resource that can be used elsewhere in the application
and it also sets a JNDI Entry under a name that can be used in `persistence.xml`.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd"
	version="3.0">
 
	<persistence-unit name="jdbcappDataSource" transaction-type="JTA">
		<jta-data-source>java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource</jta-data-source>
	</persistence-unit>
	
</persistence>
```

TomEE, GlassFish and WildFly all are able to use database drivers that are included with the application.
However, Open Liberty does not use that classpath. To workaround this issue, one must set the drivers
in the global classpath by having this block in `server.xml` (where the variables refer to JAR files
in the file system.)

```
<library id="global">
	<file name="${derbypath}" />
	<file name="${derbyclientpath}" />
	<file name="${derbytoolspath}" />
	<file name="${derbysharedpath}" />
</library>
```

The pros of this approach include the simplicity. However, the main con is that the connection
information to the database is included in the code and is not externalized. Some app servers
support means of using environment variables, but the naming convention is inconsistent across
app servers. See this link for more information:

```
https://dplatz.de/blog/2018/self-contained-jee-app.html
```

Having to re-build an application to adjust connection information or pool settings is not
a position you want to be in,

[2] Using persistence.xml
=====================
The schema for `persistence.xml` includes a way to specify a database connection like so:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd"
	version="3.0">
 
	<persistence-unit name="jdbcAppDataSource" transaction-type="JTA">
		<provider>org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider</provider>
		<properties>
			<property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver"
				value="org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver" />
			<property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url"
				value="jdbc:derby:memory:appdb;create=true" />

			<property name="eclipselink.logging.level" value="INFO" />
			<property name="eclipselink.target-database" value="DERBY" />
			<property name="eclipselink.ddl-generation"
				value="drop-and-create-tables" />
		</properties>
	</persistence-unit>
	
</persistence>
```

This shares similar pros and cons as the `@DataSourceConfiguration` but only defines a connection
for use with an `EntityManager`.

[3] Using web.xml
=============
The schema for `web.xml` also includes a way to specify a database connection like so:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/web-app_5_0.xsd"
	version="5.0">

	<data-source>
		<name>jdbc/appDataSourc</name>
		<class-name>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDataSource</class-name>
		<database-name>memory:appdb</database-name>
		<user>APP</user>
		<password></password>
		<property>
			<name>connectionAttributes</name>
			<value>create=true</value>
		</property>
	</data-source>

</web-app>
```

This defines a JNDI name at `java:comp/env/jdbc/appDataSource` that can be used to look up the connection.
I believe this name should be used in `persistence.xml` as well, however GlassFish does not interpret the
specification that way.

Likewise, this approach hard codes connection information that may or may not be easily changed without
rebuilding the application.


[4] Using App Server Specific Configuration
=======================================
This approach is the original "Java EE" one. To begin, an application defines a outlet in `web.xml` like so:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/web-app_5_0.xsd"
	version="5.0">

	<resource-ref>
		<res-ref-name>jdbc/appDataSource</res-ref-name>
		<res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
		<res-auth>Container</res-auth>
	</resource-ref>

</web-app>
```

That outlet now needs to be plugged by each app server and their approaches are different. But most
importantly, that configuration can be external to the WAR file, meaning code does not need to be
changed. This makes this approach good. For convenience, configuration files can be included with
the code. This approach is described below:

Open Liberty
------------
To map the name used in the application to the name used in Open Liberty, include a file named
`ibm.web.bnd.xml` in the `WEB-INF` directory as a sibling to `web.xml` that looks as follows:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-bnd xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xmlns="http://websphere.ibm.com/xml/ns/javaee"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://websphere.ibm.com/xml/ns/javaee http://websphere.ibm.com/xml/ns/javaee/ibm-web-bnd_1_0.xsd"
	version="1.0">

	<resource-ref name="jdbc/appDataSource"
		binding-name="jdbc/appDataSource" />

</web-bnd>
```

The names can be different, but for sanity, everyone uses the same name.

Next, the database connection configuration is in `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<server description="jpa">

	<featureManager>
		<feature>jakartaee-9.1</feature>
		<feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
	</featureManager>

	<variable name="default.http.port" defaultValue="9080" />
	<variable name="default.https.port" defaultValue="9443" />

	<httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint"
		httpPort="${default.http.port}" httpsPort="${default.https.port}" />
	
	<library id="derby">
		<file name="${derbypath}" />
		<file name="${derbyclientpath}" />
		<file name="${derbytoolspath}" />
		<file name="${derbysharedpath}" />
	</library>

	<!-- See persistence.xml and web.xml -->
	<dataSource id="appDataSource"
		jndiName="jdbc/appDataSource">
		<jdbcDriver libraryRef="derby" />
		<connectionManager minPoolSize="1"/>
		<properties.derby.embedded
			databaseName="memory:appdb"
			createDatabase="create"
			user="APP"
			password="" />
	</dataSource>

</server>
```

The JNDI name `java:comp/env/jdbc/appDataSource` is used to look up the data source and
can also be used in `persistence.xml`.

WildFly
-------
WildFly data sources are defined in files ending in `-ds.xml` such as `wildfly-ds.xml` or `wildfly-app-ds.xml`
should be located in the `WEB-INF` directory as a sibling of `web.xml`.

Here is an example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<datasources xmlns="http://www.jboss.org/ironjacamar/schema"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.org/ironjacamar/schema http://docs.jboss.org/ironjacamar/schema/datasources_1_0.xsd">

	<!-- Wildfly DataSources -->

	<datasource jndi-name="jdbc/appDataSource" pool-name="DerbyDS">
		<connection-url>jdbc:derby:memory:appdb;create=true</connection-url>
		<driver>appdriver</driver>
		<pool></pool>
		<security>
			<user-name>APP</user-name>
			<password></password>
		</security>
	</datasource>

	<drivers>
		<driver name="appdriver">
			<xa-datasource-class>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDataSource</xa-datasource-class>
		</driver>
	</drivers>

</datasources>
```

The JNDI name `java:comp/env/jdbc/appDataSource` is used to look up the data source and
can also be used in `persistence.xml`.

TomEE
-----
TomEE data sources are defined in a file called `resources.xml` and
should be located in the `WEB-INF` directory as a sibling of `web.xml`.

Here is an example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<resources>

	<!-- TomEE App Server Resources -->

	<Resource id="jdbc/appDataSource" type="DataSource">
	    #Embedded Derby for TomEE server
	
	    JdbcDriver org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
	    JdbcUrl jdbc:derby:memory:appdb;create=true
	    UserName APP
	    Password 
	</Resource>
</resources>
```

The JNDI name `java:comp/env/jdbc/appDataSource` is used to look up the data source and
can also be used in `persistence.xml`.

GlassFish
---------
GlassFish data sources are defined in a file called `glassfish-resources.xml` and
should be located in the `WEB-INF` directory as a sibling of `web.xml`.

Here is an example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE resources PUBLIC "-//GlassFish.org//DTD GlassFish Application Server 3.1 Resource Definitions//EN"
        "http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-resources_1_5.dtd">
<resources>

	<!-- GlassFish App Server Resources -->
	
	<jdbc-resource
		jndi-name="jdbc/appDataSource"
		pool-name="jdbcAppDataSource"
		object-type="user">
	</jdbc-resource>

	<jdbc-connection-pool
		name="jdbcAppDataSource"
		res-type="javax.sql.DataSource" 
		datasource-classname="org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDataSource">

		<!-- https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.1/publishedapi/org/apache/derby/jdbc/EmbeddedDataSource.html -->
		<property name="databaseName" value="memory:appdb"/>
		<property name="createDatabase" value="create"/> 

		<property name="user" value="APP" />
		<property name="password" value="" />
	</jdbc-connection-pool>

</resources>
```

The GlassFish Conundrum
-----------------------

The full JNDI names registered in GlassFish are different than other app servers.
Furthermore, their Entity Manager Factory system is not implemented to have visibility
to the `resource-ref` names in `web.xml`. This make GlassFish a thorn in the side of
anyone trying to create an app that can work in any app server.

On top of that, GlassFish seems to configure data sources differently in the EJB
classpath versus a webapp classpath. It seems as though in the EJB side, the setPassword()
method is not called on the DataSource, but instead invokes getConnection(u,p) as if
there is no connection pool. I don't know.

Is it for these reasons, that this project went with the `@DataSourceConfiguration` with a
custom `DataSource` approach (see below) so that people wanting to run the code need not
change any code. It has a bunch of logic that smoothes over all the differences between
the app servers.

Connecting the Dots
-------------------

If you got lost in how everything connects together, perhaps this helps.

An OpenLiberty data Source is configured from this file: `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`

It uses the Jakarta EE Web Profile with JNDI support. The database connection information
is in this file. You will find that the `jdbc/appDataSource` connects to:

```
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ibm-bnd-web.xml
```

Alternatively, one could use:

```
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/resources.xml (TomEE)
```

or

```
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wildfly-ds.xml (WildFly)
```

or

```
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/glassfish-resources.xml (GlassFish)
```

The JNDI names in these previous files connect to

```
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
```

which connects to

```
src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
```

which connects to

```
Appervice.java

@PersistenceContext(unitName = "jdbcAppDataSource")
EntityManager entityManager;
```

The `server.xml` has a `derbypath` variable that is set in `pom.xml`

[5] Using @DataSourceDefinition with Custom DataSource
======================================================
This approach gives developers the most control over how the DataSource is built.
In other words, developers implement the `DataSource` interface and do what is needed.
The `@DataSourceDefinition` annotation would reference that implementation like so
(this is for web apps):

```
@DataSourceDefinition(
		name = "java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource",
		className = "io.github.learnjakartaee.sql.SpelConfigurableDataSource",
		url = "EVAL(env['DB_URL'] ?: properties['db.url'] ?: 'jdbc:derby:memory:appdb%3Bcreate=true')",
		user = "EVAL(env['DB_USERNAME'] ?: properties['db.user'] ?: 'APP')",
		password = "EVAL(env(['DB_PASSWORD'] ?: properties['db.password'] ?: '')",
		properties = {
				"driverClassName=EVAL(env['DB_DRIVER'] ?: properties['db.driver'] ?: 'org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver')"
		})
@ApplicationScoped
public class DataSourceConfiguration {

	@Resource(lookup = "java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource")
	DataSource dataSource;

	@Produces
	@AppDataSource
	public DataSource getDatasource() {
		return dataSource;
	}
}
```

and the `DataSource` class might look as follows:

```
public class SpelConfigurableDataSource extends HikariDataSource {
}
```

In this case, the `SpelConfigurableDataSource` class that is in the '`learn-jakartaee-datasource`
project gives one a Hikari Connection Pool that can be configured across all app servers
with connection information stored consistently in environment variables or system properties.
Default values are also supported.

As an example, see `wildfly.cli` how it sets system properties to be used. No one needs
to re-compile the code to use a different database, assuming the app contains the 
proper database drivers.

But that is just one implementation. Another implementation might be to delegate to
another DataSource looked up via JNDI. This approach would be useful to get around the
GlassFish conundrum mentioned above.

An important note is that the WildFly wants the URL to be encoded. Otherwise, the
URL parameters may be truncated and leave the app in a non-working state. Note the
semicolon encoding in the above example.

An Open Liberty note is that the data source class must exist in its global
library path, and not just WEB-INF lib. So one will need to reference the datasource
project along with the Hikari and SLF4J jar files in the server.xml.

As far as Hikari goes, I did not fully complete the data source class to have support
for the Hikari connection pool configuration properties. But that is not a difficult task.

On the EJB side of things. GlassFish offers up a few more wrinkles that get solved this way:

```
@DataSourceDefinition(
		name = "java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource",
		className = "io.github.learnjakartaee.sql.SpelConfigurableDataSource",
		url = "EVAL(env['DB_URL'] ?: properties['db.url'] ?: 'jdbc:derby:memory:appdb%3Bcreate=true')",
		user = "EVAL(env['DB_USERNAME'] ?: properties['db.user'] ?: 'APP')/"
				+ "EVAL(env['DB_PASSWORD'] ?: properties['db.password'] ?: '')",
		password = "EVAL(env['DB_PASSWORD'] ?: properties['db.password'] ?: '')",
		properties = {
				"driverClassName=EVAL(env['DB_DRIVER'] ?: properties['db.driver'] ?: 'org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver')"
		})
@ApplicationScoped
@ManagedBean
public class DataSourceConfiguration {

	@Produces
	@AppDataSource
	public DataSource getDataSource() {
		return lookupDataSource();
	}

	public static DataSource lookupDataSource() {
		// JNDI Lookup here
	}
}
```

To consistently create a data source on the EJB side of things, GlassFish wants
a managed bean to hold the `@DataSourceDefinition`. And furthermore, to expose that
DataSource as a CDI bean, one must directly do a JNDI lookup. Look at the 
`DataSourceConfiguration` class in the EJB project as an example.

Spring Note:

The above example shows DataSource configurations using a Spring Expression Language (Spel)
configured definition. However, when building the EAR project, class path issues occurred
with the Spring Boot LDAP Server which has spring-core dependencies at its heart. The
"skinny-modules" setting of the maven-ear-plugin causes these JAR file dependency to be moved
to the shared `lib` directory. And that somehow prevented Spring Boot from started the application.

To remedy the situation, a new implementation based on Jakarata Expression Language was built.
An example follows:

```
@DataSourceDefinition(
		name = "java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource",
		className = "io.github.learnjakartaee.sql.ELConfigurableDataSource",
		url = "EVAL(not empty env.get('DB_URL') ? env.get('DB_URL') : "
				+ "properties.getOrDefault('db.url', 'jdbc:derby:memory:appdb%3Bcreate=true'))",
		user = "EVAL(not empty env.get('DB_USERNAME') ? env.get('DB_USERNAME') : "
				+ "properties.getOrDefault('db.user', 'APP'))/"
				+ "EVAL(not empty env.get('DB_PASSWORD') ? env.get('DB_PASSWORD') : "
				+ "properties.getOrDefault('db.password', ''))",
		password = "EVAL(not empty env.get('DB_PASSWORD') ? env.get('DB_PASSWORD') : "
				+ "properties.getOrDefault('db.password', ''))",
		properties = {
				"driverClassName=EVAL(not empty env.get('DB_DRIVER') ? env.get('DB_DRIVER') : "
						+ "properties.getOrDefault('db.driver', 'org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'))"
		})
@ApplicationScoped
@ManagedBean
public class DataSourceConfiguration {
}
```

It is not as concise as Spel, but does not have external dependencies. As is, users of the
data source project must now provide language dependencies of their choosing. Sigh.

Finally, I created one based on `Environment` properties, as appears in the EJB project:

```
@DataSourceDefinition(
		name = "java:app/env/jdbc/appDataSource",
		className = "io.github.learnjakartaee.sql.ELConfigurableDataSource",
		url = "ENV(db.url)",
		user = "ENV(db.user)/ENV(db.password)",
		password = "ENV(db.password)",
		properties = {
				"driverClassName=ENV(db.driver)"
		})
@ApplicationScoped
@ManagedBean
public class DataSourceConfiguration {

	@Produces
	@AppDataSource
	public DataSource getDataSource() {
		return lookupDataSource();
	}

}
```
